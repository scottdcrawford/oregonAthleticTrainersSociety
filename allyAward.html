          <h1>Dr. Mark Colville Recognized as Athletic Training Ally by the Oregon Athletic Trainers’ Society</h1>
          <br>
          

          <p>March 23, 2018 – Portland, Oregon</p>

          <p>Mark Colville, MD was awarded the inaugural Oregon Athletic Trainers’ Society (OATS) Athletic Training Ally Award at the OATS Annual Business Meeting in Portland, Oregon on March 23, 2018.</p> 

          <p>The award is designed to recognize an individual or organization that promotes and supports the athletic training profession by providing services that lead to the betterment of health care for the physically active population or the advocacy and advancement of the athletic training profession.</p>  

          <p>Dr. Colville is an orthopedic surgeon for Rebound Orthopedics and Neurosurgery in Portland, Oregon. For over 30 years, Dr. Colville has served the athletic training community in the role of team physician for multiple teams, including the Portland Winterhawks Hockey Club, Concordia University, George Fox University, and Portland State University. </p>

          <p>“Dr. Colville has consistently given countless hours educating and mentoring many students and certified athletic trainers,” OATS member Jennifer Krug, ATC said. “He has shown students and athletic trainers how to deal with stressful situations in the most caring manner, while always doing what is best for the safety of the athlete. Dr. Colville continually advocates for athletic trainers and realizes the importance of communicating this to other physicians and healthcare professionals. He has told me, without athletic trainers his job would be much harder because he relies on us to give him pertinent information following an athlete’s injury and subsequent care. Those who have worked with Dr. Colville are forever impacted by his respect to the athletic training profession, his love of teaching others and for being a role model.”</p>

          <p>This sentiment was echoed by Portland Winterhawks Athletic Trainer Rich Campbell, ATC. “Dr. Mark Colville has been team physician for the Portland Winterhawks hockey team for more than 20 years prior to my arrival in 2008. After our first meeting to establish a medical team, I knew we were in good hands. Being a hockey player himself, Mark understands the game of hockey and the highly competitive nature of the sport and its players. His easy-going personality combined with his prowess, leaves players, parents, and coaches feeling confident. He and his group are true professionals when accommodating and delivering the highest standard of medical care.”</p> 

          <p>During the awards ceremony, Jim Wallis, ATC, Head Athletic Trainer for Portland State University said the following to Dr. Colville: “The best of the best needs to be recognized. I believe, and many others as well, that you are the best of the best. You have always supported us professionally and personally and it has made each of us better athletic trainers and more importantly better human beings.”</p>


          <p><em>Athletic trainers are health care professionals with expertise in the prevention, assessment, treatment, and rehabilitation of acute and chronic athletic injuries and conditions. The mission of the Oregon Athletic Trainers’ Society is to enhance the quality of health care provided by certified athletic trainers and to advance the profession of Athletic Training in the state of Oregon. The mission shall be accomplished through strong working relationships, education, and fellowship among athletic trainers and who they influence.</em></p>
