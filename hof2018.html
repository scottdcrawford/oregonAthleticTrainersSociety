          <h1>The Oregon Athletic Trainers’ Society Inducts Two into Hall of Fame</h1>
          <br>
          

          <p>March 23, 2018 – Portland, Oregon</p>

          <p>Cari Wood, ATC and Erin Cramer, PA-C, ATC were inducted into the Oregon Athletic Trainers’ Society (OATS) Hall of Fame at the OATS Annual Business Meeting in Portland, Oregon on March 23, 2018. The Hall of Fame is the highest honor bestowed by OATS and is to recognize athletic trainers who have made significant and lasting impact on the profession of athletic training in Oregon. Cari and Erin join nine other members of the OATS Hall of Fame. </p>

          <p>Cari Wood, ATC is the athletic trainer for Redmond High School and Desert Orthopedics in Redmond, Oregon. Cari has served OATS as President (2003-2007), Vice President (1999-2003), Public Relations Chair (1997-1999), and as Secondary School Committee Member (1997-2003). She was also a member of the Oregon School Activities Association Sports Medicine Advisory Committee (2003-2007). At the regional level Cari was the Northwest Athletic Trainers’ Society’s President (2013-2017) and Secretary (2007-2012) and has served on the Board of Directors since 2003. At the national level she served on the National Athletic Trainers’ Association Board of Directors from (2013-2017) and was awarded the Athletic Training Service Award by the organization. In addition to the professional service, Cari has been active in her community through many local organizations.  </p>

          <p>“She’s done it all and done it well,” OATS Past-President Greg Hill, ATC said. “She’s pulled people in to be involved and has made sure that people are recognized for their contributions and accomplishments. She does it all with a high and positive energy level. She’s had bad days, but only those very close to her would ever know that, and she will still smile and pick other people up through the bad days. She’s been a leader, mentor, advisor, coach, role-model, and friend to many, many athletic trainers around the state and region. She was the first one to achieve Safe School status in Oregon. She has served on multiple committees throughout Oregon, the region and nationally. She’s active in the community. She cares about her students, co-workers, and colleagues and they all know it. She makes everyone feel special and important. Cari is the type of person that others wish that they could be, and they try to emulate.”</p>

          <p>Cari’s colleague at Desert Orthopedics Jordan Bigam, ATC said, “In Central Oregon, Cari has been regarded as one of ‘the best’ athletic trainers. Several of her previous athletes have noted the large impact Cari has had on their lives by treating them with respect and care during the emotional times of injuries. Her commitment to the profession, along with her personality and willingness to serve, are the qualities worthy of the OATS Hall of Fame. I can’t think of anyone more deserving or more a model of what the achievement should represent than Cari Wood.”</p>

          <p>Erin Cramer, PA-C, ATC is a physician assistant and athletic trainer at Sublimity Medical Clinic, part of Santiam Hospital, in Sublimity, Oregon. Previous his current role as a physician assistant, Erin was an athletic trainer and educator at both the high school and college level. Erin served as OATS President (1999-2003) and was instrumental crafting Oregon’s Athletic Training Practice Act. He is a long-serving member of the Oregon School Activities Association’s Sports Medicine Advisory Committee. Erin is on the Board of Certification for the Athletic Trainer’s Board of Directors and served as their Vice President from 2014-2017. Additionally, he serves on the Oregon Society of Physician Assistants’ Government Affairs Committee.</p>

          <p>“I have known Erin for nearly 20 years and hold him in the highest regard as one of my most respected colleagues,” former OATS President Shelly Jones, ATC noted. “Erin is an absolute delight and someone you’d get excited to work a 14-hour day with. He brightens your day simply by being in it. From helping pass our state practice act, to him serving as OATS President, and sitting on the OSAA Sports Medicine Advisory Committee, Erin is worthy of this recognition. His contributions to our state have been considerable and he is definitely one of my most trusted colleagues.”</p>
          
          <p>“I've always admired Erin's ability to consider a situation and keenly discern the important issues from the unimportant,” OATS Hall of Fame member and former OATS President Dave Sherden, ATC said. “His work writing the Administrative Rules for the original registration law was invaluable.  He patiently and wisely updated the OATS constitution and bylaws, and left the organization more functional than he inherited it.”</p>

          <p><em>Athletic trainers are health care professionals with expertise in the prevention, assessment, treatment, and rehabilitation of acute and chronic athletic injuries and conditions. The mission of the Oregon Athletic Trainers’ Society is to enhance the quality of health care provided by certified athletic trainers and to advance the profession of Athletic Training in the state of Oregon. The mission shall be accomplished through strong working relationships, education, and fellowship among athletic trainers and who they influence.</em></p>
